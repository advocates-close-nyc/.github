#### Clockmaking 
Here, the need is to define clocks in a way is infinitely scalable (in other words, it cannot be the case that we are limited to some number of clocks or other counters per core or otherwise in a quantum system. It was worth figuring a way out of this problem so please take the time to present this one properly.
