#### Clockmaking 
Here, the need is to define clocks in a way is infinitely scalable (in other words, it cannot be the case that we are limited to some number of clocks or other counters per core or otherwise in a quantum system. It was worth figuring a way out of this problem so please take the time to present this one properly.

## Corporate Advisory
I am here to put the Wachtell people out of work. Corporate boards are useless; to claim otherwise at a time when a fleet of drones would do a much better job of at least monitoring the goings on within the company for which it had been charged with monitoring. Realistically shareholders would be better off with no board than with the boards that exist today. I would like shareholders to be able to monitor and to influence what will become of their investments and that drones are well suited to this task
