# Advocates Close 

I am an attorney admitted to practice in the State of New York. I wish to start my own firm and hope to compete for interesting work. There are good reasons for this work to stay in the hands of however has it right now; I believe that the argument in favor of the incumbent guy is that, in a sense, it aint broke. The more it aint broke, the greater will need to be the value of what I am able to offer, the likelihood of what I am able to offer, or both, in expectation. 

The way I see it, I have one idea that I really do believe is a good one, and that is the idea that is developed at length below. The other is to ask someone to believe something that I myself do not believe and, even if this approach was somehow preferrable, the fact is that I do not know myself to be a person who has ever been particularly able to play this angle with any kind of success and, truthfully, nor have I ever bothered to even try. As such, there's really one play here. I know there are reasons not to go in this direction. I have considered the alternatives and believe them to be worse. As such, it is decided.
