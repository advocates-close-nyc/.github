## Corporate Advisory
I offer compiler-checked execution environments with provable guarantees as to correctness and a runtime executable; I write agreements in code and this allows me to use a machine to help you get what you actually wanted in the first place. The other guy has "generative AI" now and, astonishingly, believes it holds the potential to change everything because, suddenly, one can teach a computer to be just like computer from before--but worse. Rather than make the lawyer smarter, we are apparently now trying to make eveything else dumber. If you think that makes sense, then I am sure you are right and can tell you that you probably also have the right lawyer for you as well. 

If you care about not losing money or otherwise getting things wrong, then I can help you with that.
